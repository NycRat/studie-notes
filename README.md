# Studie Notes

## Inspiration
The inspiration for the project was to build a web app that helps students organize their notes, and documents for school.

## What it does
Studie Notes stores notes and organizes notes into their classes. When notes are grouped into classes, it is much easier and faster for students to organize and find notes from a their class. Studie Notes can be used by students, teachers, or anyone that wants to have an easier time organizing their documents.

## How I built it
The Studie Notes website was built using Typescript, React.js, Redux, and CSS. The backend server was built with Rust and Rocket and uses MongoDB as the database.

## What's next for Studie Notes
The next step is to allow sharing of notes. When notes can be shared, this can be used to collaborate on group projects, and teachers can share class notes with students.
